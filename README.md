# Book Store API
Welcome to the Book Store API! This project is a backend implementation for managing a book store, including features like inventory management, cart operations, checkout, and transaction handling. Built using FastAPI and MySQL, this API supports efficient and scalable operations.

## Features
  1. Shelf Management:

  - Display books available in the store.

  - Filter by genre and status (e.g., available, booked, out_of_stock).

  2. Cart Operations:

  - Add items to the cart.

  - Remove items or adjust quantities.

  - Validate stock availability before checkout.

  3. Checkout:

  - Process purchases from the cart.

  - Update inventory (record table).

  - Record transactions in the transaction table.

  4. Transaction Management:

  - Record each purchase with unique transaction IDs.

  - Fetch transaction history for auditing purposes.

  5. Inventory Updates:

  - Automatically update product status (available, out_of_stock) based on stock levels.

  6. Tech Stack
  - Backend Framework: FastAPI

  - Database: MySQL

  - Language: Python

  - UUID Generation: Python's uuid module
